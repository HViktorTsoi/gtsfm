/*  Gives the DivNode.js component a black curved border with some padding to center the text within it. 
    Text is centered vertically within the node.
    Cursor becomes a pointer when hovering over it.

    A Div Node is just a short hand name for any of the 43 nodes within the GTSFM Landing Page Graph. It's called a 
    "Div Node", primarily because in code, it is a div (a rectangulear container to hold text), while in concept,
    it serves as a node/vertex in a directed graph.
